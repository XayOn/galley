"In printing and publishing, proofs are the preliminary versions of publications meant for review by authors, editors, and proofreaders, often with extra-wide margins"

Galley allows for a form of peer-review on ocr scans.

For that matter, the following considerations are taken:

- A scan, to be marked as correct, must have a consensus of at least 3 edits over the edits.
  That's a two-fase approval:
  - All edits generate revisable versions.
    Once a revisable version has 3 approvals from different users without any
    change, it's automatically approved and the page locked.
  For an edit to be considered "really-similar", it has to be
- User doesn't need to be logged in, they'll be identified by a browser fingerprint
